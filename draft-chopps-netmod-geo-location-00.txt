Abstract

   This document defines a generic geographical location object in YANG.
   The geo location object is intended to be used for specifying a
   location on or in reference to the Earth or any other astronomical
   object.

1.  Introduction

   In many applications we would like to specify the location of
   something geographically.  Some examples of locations in networking
   might be the location of data center, a rack in an internet exchange
   point, a router, a firewall, a port on some device, or it could be
   the endpoints of a fiber, or perhaps the failure point along a fiber.

   Additionally, while this location is typically relative to The Earth,
   it does not need to be.  Indeed it is easy to imagine a network or
   device located on The Moon, on Mars, on Enceladus (the moon of
   Saturn) or even a comet (e.g., 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko).

   Finally, one can imagine defining locations using a different frames
   of reference or even alternate systems (e.g., a virtual reality).

   This document defines a "geo-location"YANG grouping that allows for
   all of the above data to be captured.

   The YANG data model described in this document conforms to the
   Network Management Datastore Architecture defined in [RFC8342].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] [RFC8174]when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
   as shown here.

2.  The Geo Location Object

2.1.  Frame of Reference

   The frame of reference ( "reference-frame") defines what the location
   values refer to and their meaning.  The referred to object can be any
   astronomical body.  It could be a planet such as The Earth or Mars, a
   moon such as Enceladus, an asteroid such as Ceres, or even a comet
   such as 1P/Halley.  This value is specified in "astronomical-body"and
   is defined by the International Astronomical Union (
   http://www.iau.org), The default "astronomical-body"value is "earth".

   In addition to identifying the astronomical body we also need to
   define the meaning of latitude and longitude and how the reference 0
   height is determined.  This is done with a "geodetic-datum"value.
   The default value for "geodetic-datum"is "wgs-84"(i.e., the World
   Geodetic System, WGS-84), which is used by the Global Positioning
   System (GPS).  We define an IANA registry for specifying standard
   values for the "geodetic-datum".

   Finally, we define an optional feature which allows for changing the
   system for which the above values are defined.  This optional feature
   adds an "alternate-system"value to the reference frame.  This value
   is normally not present which implies the natural universe is the
   system.  The use of this value is intended to allow for creating
   virtual realities or perhaps alternate coordinate systems.  The
   definition of alternate systems is outside the scope of this
   document.

2.2.  Location

   This is the location on or relative to the astronomical object.  It
   is specified using three coordinates: Latitude, Longitude, and
   Height.  The Latitude and Longitude are specified as fractions of
   degrees of 360 and their meaning is defined by the "geodetic-
   datum"value in the Section 2.1.  The Height value is in fractional
   meters above or below a "0" reference point.  This "0" refrence point
   is also defined by the "geodetic-datum"value.

2.3.  Motion

   Limited support is added for objects in motion.  For objects in
   motion there are an additional 2 values to describe the an objects
   velocity, "heading"and "speed".  The "heading"value is relative to
   true-north as defined by the "reference-frame"for the astronomical
   body.  For some applications that demand high accuracy, and where the
   data is infrequently updated this value might also track very slow
   movement such as continental drift.

2.4.  Tree

   The following is the YANG tree diagram [RFC8340]for the geo-location
   grouping.

     grouping geo-location

          +-- reference-frame

          +-- velocity
          |  +-- heading?   degrees

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  Geodetic System Value Registry

   This registry allocates names for standard geodetic systems.  Often
   these values are referred to using multiple names (e.g., full names
   or multiple acronyms values).  The intent of this registry is to
   provide a single standard value for any given geodetic system.

   The values SHOULD use an acronym when available, they MUST be
   converted to lower case, and spaces MUST be changed to dashes "-".

   The allocation policy for this registry is First Come First Served,
   [RFC5226] as the intent is simply to avoid duplicate values.

   The initial values for this registry are as follows.

           +------------+-------------------------------------+
           | Name       | Description                         |
           +============+=====================================+
           | wgs-84     | World Geodetic System 1984          |
           +------------+-------------------------------------+
           | egm-2008   | Earth Gravitational Model 2008      |
           +------------+-------------------------------------+
           | me         | Mean Earth/Polar Axis (Moon)        |
           +------------+-------------------------------------+
           | mola-vik-1 | MOLA Height, IAU Viking-1 PM (Mars) |
