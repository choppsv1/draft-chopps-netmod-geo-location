#+begin_abstract
This document defines a generic geographical location object YANG
grouping. The geographical location grouping is intended to be used
in YANG models for specifying a location on or in reference to the
Earth or any other astronomical object.
#+end_abstract

* Introduction

In many applications we would like to specify the location of
something geographically. Some examples of locations in networking
might be the location of data center, a rack in an internet exchange
point, a router, a firewall, a port on some device, or it could be
the endpoints of a fiber, or perhaps the failure point along a fiber.

Additionally, while this location is typically relative to The Earth,
it does not need to be. Indeed it is easy to imagine a network or
device located on The Moon, on Mars, on Enceladus (the moon of
Saturn) or even a comet (e.g., 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko).

Finally, one can imagine defining locations using a different frames
of reference or even alternate systems (e.g., a simulations or
virtual realities).

This document defines a ~geo-location~ YANG grouping that allows for
all of the above data to be captured.

This specification conforms to [[ISO.6709.2008]].

The YANG data model described in this document conforms to the
Network Management Datastore Architecture defined in [[RFC8342]].

** Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [[RFC2119]] [[RFC8174]] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
   as shown here.

* The Geo Location Object
*** Frame of Reference

    The frame of reference (~reference-frame~) defines what the
    location values refer to and their meaning. The referred to
    object can be any astronomical body. It could be a planet such as
    The Earth or Mars, a moon such as Enceladus, an asteroid such as
    Ceres, or even a comet such as 1P/Halley. This value is specified
    in ~astronomical-body~ and is defined by the International
    Astronomical Union ([[http://www.iau.org]]), The default
    ~astronomical-body~ value is =earth=.

    In addition to identifying the astronomical body we also need to
    define the meaning of the coordinates (e.g., latitude and
    longitude) and the definition of 0-height. This is done with a
    ~geodetic-datum~ value. The default value for ~geodetic-datum~ is
    =wgs-84= (i.e., the World Geodetic System, [[WGS84]]), which is used
    by the Global Positioning System (GPS) among many others. We
    define an IANA registry for specifying standard values for the
    ~geodetic-datum~.

    In addition to the ~geodetic-datum~ value we allow refining the
    coordinate and height accuracy using ~coord-accuracy~ and
    ~height-accuracy~ respectively. When specified these values
    override the defaults implied by the ~geodetic-datum~ value.

    Finally, we define an optional feature which allows for changing
    the system for which the above values are defined. This optional
    feature adds an ~alternate-system~ value to the reference frame.
    This value is normally not present which implies the natural
    universe is the system. The use of this value is intended to
    allow for creating virtual realities or perhaps alternate
    coordinate systems. The definition of alternate systems is
    outside the scope of this document.

*** Location

    This is the location on or relative to the astronomical object.
    It is specified using 2 or 3 coordinates values. These values are
    given either as ~latitude~, ~longitude~, and an optional
    ~height~, or as Cartesian coordinates of ~x~, ~y~ and an optional
    ~z~. For the standard location choice ~latitude~ and ~longitude~
    are specified as fractions of decimal degrees, and the ~height~
    value is in fractions of meters. For the Cartesian choice ~x~,
    ~y~ and ~z~ are in fractions of meters. In both choices the exact
    meanings of all of the values are defined by the ~geodetic-datum~
    value in the [[Frame of Reference]].

*** Motion

    Limited support is added for objects in motion. For objects in
    motion there are an additional 2 values to describe a velocity;
    these are ~heading~ and ~speed~. The ~heading~ value is relative
    to true-north as defined by the ~reference-frame~ for the
    astronomical body. The ~speed~ value is in fractional meters per
    second. For some applications that demand high accuracy, and
    where the data is infrequently updated this value might also
    track very slow movement such as continental drift.

** Tree

   The following is the YANG tree diagram [[RFC8340]] for the
   geo-location grouping.

* ISO 6709:2008 Conformance

[[ISO.6709.2008]] provides an appendix with a set of tests for
conformance to the standard. The tests and results are given in the
following table along with an explanation of non-applicable tests.

#+CAPTION: Conformance Test Results
| Test    | Description                              | Pass Explanation        |
|---------+------------------------------------------+-------------------------|
| A.1.2.1 | elements reqd. for a geo. point location | CRS is always indicated |
| A.1.2.2 | Description of a CRS from a register     | CRS register is defined |
| A.1.2.3 | definition of CRS                        | N/A - Don't define CRS  |
| A.1.2.4 | representation of horizontal position    | lat/long values conform |
| A.1.2.5 | representation of vertical position      | height value conforms   |
| A.1.2.6 | text string representation               | N/A - No string format  |

For test =A.1.2.1= the YANG geo location object either includes a CRS
(~reference-frame~) or has a default defined ([[WGS84]]).

For =A.1.2.3= we do not define our own CRS, and doing so is not
required for conformance.

For =A.1.2.6= we do not define a text string representation, which is
also not required for conformance.

* Usability

The geo-location object defined in this document and YANG module have
been designed to be usable in a very broad set of applications.
This includes the ability to locate things on astronomical bodies
other than The Earth, and to utilize entirely different coordinate
systems and realities.

Many systems make use of geo-location data, and so it's important to
be able describe this data using this geo-location object defined in
this document.

** Portability

#   DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-35973-1_904
#   Percivall G. (2008) OGC's Open Standards for Geospatial
#   Interoperability. In: Shekhar S., Xiong H. (eds) Encyclopedia of
#   GIS. Springer, Boston, MA

In order to verify portability while developing this module the
following standards and standard APIs and were considered.

*** IETF URI Value

[[RFC5870]] defines a standard URI value for geographic location data. It
includes the ability to specify the ~geodetic-value~ (it calls this
~crs~) with the default being =wgs-84= [[WGS84]]. For the location data
it allows 2 to 3 coordinates defined by the ~crs~ value. For accuracy
it has a single ~u~ parameter for specifying uncertainty. The ~u~
value is in fractions of meters and applies to all the location
values. As the URI is a string, all values are specifies as strings
and so are capable of as much precision as required.

URI values can be mapped to and from the YANG grouping, with the
caveat that some loss of precision (in the extremes) may occur due to
the YANG grouping using decimal64 values rather than strings.

*** W3C

See https://w3c.github.io/geolocation-api/#dom-geolocationposition.

W3C Defines a geo-location API in [[W3CGEO]]. We show a snippet of
code below which defines the geo-location data for this API. This is
used by many application (e.g., Google Maps API).

#+CAPTION: Snippet Showing Geo-Location Defintion

**** Compare with YANG Model

| Field            | Type         | YANG            | Type        |
|------------------+--------------+-----------------+-------------|
| accuracy         | double       | coord-accuracy  | dec64 fr 6  |
| altitude         | double       | height          | dec64 fr 6  |
| altitudeAccuracy | double       | height-accuracy | dec64 fr 6  |
| heading          | double       | heading         | dec64 fr 16 |
| latitude         | double       | latitude        | dec64 fr 16 |
| longitude        | double       | longitude       | dec64 fr 16 |
| speed            | double       | speed           | dec64 fr 12 |
| timestamp        | DOMTimeStamp | timestamp       | string      |

- accuracy (double) :: Accuracy of ~latitude~ and ~longitude~ values
     in meters.
- altitude (double) :: Optional height in meters above the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid.
- altitudeAccuracy (double) :: Optional accuracy of ~altitude~ value
     in meters.
- heading (double) :: Optional Direction in decimal deg from true
     north increasing clock-wise.
- latitude, longitude (double) :: Standard lat/long values in decimal degrees.
- speed (double) :: Speed along heading in meters per second.
- timestamp (DOMTimeStamp) :: Specifies milliseconds since the Unix
     EPOCH in 64 bit unsigned integer. The YANG model defines the
     timestamp with arbitrarily large precision by using a string
     which encompasses all representable values of this timestamp
     value.

W3C API values can be mapped to the YANG grouping, with the caveat
that some loss of precision (in the extremes) may occur due to the
YANG grouping using decimal64 values rather than doubles.

Conversely, only YANG values for The Earth using the default
=wgs-84= [[WGS84]] as the ~geodetic-datum~, can be directly mapped to the
W3C values, as W3C does not provide the extra features necessary to
map the broader set of values supported by the YANG grouping.

*** Geography Markup Language (GML)

ISO adopted the Geography Markup Language (GML) defined by OGC 07-036
as [[ISO.19136.2007]]. GML defines, among many other things, a position
type =gml:pos= which is a sequence of ~double~ values. This sequence
of values represent coordinates in a given CRS. The CRS is either
inherited from containing elements or directly specified as
attributes ~srsName~ and optionally ~srsDimension~ on the ~gml:pos~.

GML defines an Abstract CRS type which Concrete CRS types derive
from. This allows for many types of CRS definitions. We are concerned
with the Geodetic CRS type which can have either ellipsoidal or
Cartesian coordinates. We believe that other non-Earth based CRS as
well as virtual CRS should also be representable by the GML CRS types
as well.

Thus GML ~gml:pos~ values can be mapped directly to the YANG
grouping, with the caveat that some loss of precision (in the
extremes) may occur due to the YANG grouping using decimal64 values
rather than doubles.

Conversely, YANG grouping values can be mapped to GML as directly as
the GML CRS available definitions allow with a minimum of Earth-based
geodetic systems fully supported.

GML also defines an observation value in ~gml:Observation~ which
includes a timestamp value ~gml:validTime~ in addition to other
components such as ~gml:using~ ~gml:target~ and ~gml:resultOf~. Only
the timestamp is mappable to and from the YANG grouping. Furthermore
~gml:validTime~ can either be an Instantaneous measure
(~gml:TimeInstant~) or a time period (~gml:TimePeriod~). Only the
instantaneous ~gml:TimeInstant~ is mappable to and from the YANG
grouping.

*** KML 2.3

KML2.2 [[KML22]] (formerly Keyhole Markup Language) was submitted by
Google to Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
[[https://www.opengeospatial.org/]] and was adopted. The latest version
as of this writing is [[KML23]]. This schema includes geographic location
data in some of it's objects (e.g., the <camera> object). This data
is provided in string format and corresponds to the [[W3CGEO]] values.
The timestamp value is also specified as a string as in our YANG
grouping.

The KML location values use a geodetic datum defined in Annex A by
the GML Coordinate Reference System (CRS) [[ISO.19136.2007]] with identifier
~LonLat84_5773~. The altitude value is measured from the vertical datum
specified by [[WGS84]].

* IANA Considerations
** Geodetic System Value Registry

This registry allocates names for standard geodetic systems. Often
these values are referred to using multiple names (e.g., full names
or multiple acronyms values). The intent of this registry is to
provide a single standard value for any given geodetic system.

The values SHOULD use an acronym when available, they MUST be
converted to lower case, and spaces MUST be changed to dashes "-".

It should be noted that [[RFC5870]] also has a registry for Geodetic
Systems (it calls CRS); however, this registry has a very strict
policy which is believed by the author to be too strict for easily
using.

An open question is whether we should create a new registry or
attempt to modify the existing one. It's worth noting that we include
the ability to specify any geodetic system including ones designed
for astronomical bodies other than the earth, as well as ones based
on alternate systems. These requirements may be too broad for
adpating the existing [[RFC5870]] registry.

The allocation policy for this registry is First Come First Served,
[RFC5226] as the intent is simply to avoid duplicate values.

The initial values for this registry are as follows.

# XXX check out: ISO TS 19127

Direct position instances hold the coordinates for a position within some coordinate reference system (CRS).
Since direct positions, as data types, will often be included in larger objects (such as geometry elements) that
have references to CRS, the srsName attribute will in general be missing, if this particular direct position is
included in a larger element with such a reference to a CRS. In this case, the CRS is implicitly assumed to take on
the value of the containing object's CRS.
The attribute group gml:SRSReferenceGroup is described in 10.1.3.2. If no srsName attribute is given, the
CRS shall be specified as part of the larger context this geometry element is part of, typically a geometric object
like a point, curve, etc.
NOTE It is expected that the attribute will be specified at the direct position level only in rare cases.
D.2.3.4 specifies the implementation of ISO 19107 DirectPosition by
these schema components.



10.1.3.2 SRSReferenceGroup
<attributeGroup name="SRSReferenceGroup">
<attribute name="srsName" type="anyURI" />
<attribute name="srsDimension" type="positiveInteger" />
<attributeGroup ref="gml:SRSInformationGroup"/>
</attributeGroup>
The attribute group gml:SRSReferenceGroup is an optional reference to the CRS used by this geometry, with
optional additional information to simplify the processing of the coordinates when a more complete definition of the
CRS is not needed.
In general the attribute srsName points to a CRS instance of gml:AbstractCoordinateReferenceSystem
(see 12.2.3). For well-known references it is not required that the CRS description exists at the location the URI
points to.
If no srsName attribute is given, the CRS shall be specified as part of the larger context this geometry element is
part of.
EXAMPLE A geometric aggregate or a feature collection are typical ―larger contexts‖.
NOTE The name ―srsName‖ has been chosen deliberately. In the current version of GML ―crsName‖ would be more
appropriate, however, in future versions other types of spatial reference system, i.e. those using geographic identifiers, may be
supported by GML, too.
The optional attribute srsDimension is the number of coordinate values in a position. This dimension is deriv
