<section title="Introduction">
<t>In many applications we would like to specify the location of
something geographically. Some examples of locations in networking
might be the location of data center, a rack in an internet exchange
point, a router, a firewall, a port on some device, or it could be
the endpoints of a fiber, or perhaps the failure point along a fiber.</t>

<t>Additionally, while this location is typically relative to The Earth,
it does not need to be. Indeed it is easy to imagine a network or
device located on The Moon, on Mars, on Enceladus (the moon of
Saturn) or even a comet (e.g., 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko).</t>

<t>Finally, one can imagine defining locations using a different frames
of reference or even alternate systems (e.g., a simulations or
virtual realities).</t>

<t>This document defines a <tt>geo-location</tt> YANG grouping that allows for
all of the above data to be captured.</t>

<t>This specification conforms to <xref target="ISO.6709.2008"/>.</t>

<t>The YANG data model described in this document conforms to the
Network Management Datastore Architecture defined in <xref target="RFC8342"/>.</t>

<section title="Terminology">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
<xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
as shown here.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="The Geo Location Object">
<section title="Frame of Reference" anchor="org7739d4f">
<t>The frame of reference (<tt>reference-frame</tt>) defines what the
location values refer to and their meaning. The referred to
object can be any astronomical body. It could be a planet such as
The Earth or Mars, a moon such as Enceladus, an asteroid such as
Ceres, or even a comet such as 1P/Halley. This value is specified
in <tt>astronomical-body</tt> and is defined by the International
Astronomical Union (<eref target="http://www.iau.org"/>), The default
<tt>astronomical-body</tt> value is <tt>earth</tt>.</t>

<t>In addition to identifying the astronomical body we also need to
define the meaning of the coordinates (e.g., latitude and
longitude) and the definition of 0-height. This is done with a
<tt>geodetic-datum</tt> value. The default value for <tt>geodetic-datum</tt> is
<tt>wgs-84</tt> (i.e., the World Geodetic System, <xref target="WGS84"/>), which is used
by the Global Positioning System (GPS) among many others. We
define an IANA registry for specifying standard values for the
<tt>geodetic-datum</tt>.</t>

<t>In addition to the <tt>geodetic-datum</tt> value we allow refining the
coordinate and height accuracy using <tt>coord-accuracy</tt> and
<tt>height-accuracy</tt> respectively. When specified these values
override the defaults implied by the <tt>geodetic-datum</tt> value.</t>

<t>Finally, we define an optional feature which allows for changing
the system for which the above values are defined. This optional
feature adds an <tt>alternate-system</tt> value to the reference frame.
This value is normally not present which implies the natural
universe is the system. The use of this value is intended to
allow for creating virtual realities or perhaps alternate
coordinate systems. The definition of alternate systems is
outside the scope of this document.</t>

</section>

<section title="Location">
<t>This is the location on or relative to the astronomical object.
It is specified using 2 or 3 coordinates values. These values are
given either as <tt>latitude</tt>, <tt>longitude</tt>, and an optional
<tt>height</tt>, or as Cartesian coordinates of <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt> and an optional
<tt>z</tt>. For the standard location choice <tt>latitude</tt> and <tt>longitude</tt>
are specified as fractions of decimal degrees, and the <tt>height</tt>
value is in fractions of meters. For the Cartesian choice <tt>x</tt>,
<tt>y</tt> and <tt>z</tt> are in fractions of meters. In both choices the exact
meanings of all of the values are defined by the <tt>geodetic-datum</tt>
value in the <xref target="org7739d4f"></xref>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Motion">
<t>Limited support is added for objects in motion. For objects in
motion there are an additional 2 values to describe a velocity;
these are <tt>heading</tt> and <tt>speed</tt>. The <tt>heading</tt> value is relative
to true-north as defined by the <tt>reference-frame</tt> for the
astronomical body. The <tt>speed</tt> value is in fractional meters per
second. For some applications that demand high accuracy, and
where the data is infrequently updated this value might also
track very slow movement such as continental drift.</t>

geo-location grouping.</t>

<section title="ISO 6709:2008 Conformance">
<t><xref target="ISO.6709.2008"/> provides an appendix with a set of tests for
conformance to the standard. The tests and results are given in the
following table along with an explanation of non-applicable tests.</t>

<table>
<name>Conformance Test Results</name>
<thead><tr><th>Test</th><th>Description</th><th>Pass Explanation</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr><td>A.1.2.1</td><td>elements reqd. for a geo. point location</td><td>CRS is always indicated</td></tr>
<tr><td>A.1.2.2</td><td>Description of a CRS from a register</td><td>CRS register is defined</td></tr>
<tr><td>A.1.2.3</td><td>definition of CRS</td><td>N/A - Don't define CRS</td></tr>

<tr><td>A.1.2.5</td><td>representation of vertical position</td><td>height value conforms</td></tr>
<tr><td>A.1.2.6</td><td>text string representation</td><td>N/A - No string format</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<t>For test <tt>A.1.2.1</tt> the YANG geo location object either includes a CRS
(<tt>reference-frame</tt>) or has a default defined (<xref target="WGS84"/>).</t>

<t>For <tt>A.1.2.3</tt> we do not define our own CRS, and doing so is not
required for conformance.</t>

<t>For <tt>A.1.2.6</tt> we do not define a text string representation, which is
also not required for conformance.</t>

</section>

<section title="Usability">
<t>The geo-location object defined in this document and YANG module have
been designed to be usable in a very broad set of applications.
This includes the ability to locate things on astronomical bodies
other than The Earth, and to utilize entirely different coordinate
systems and realities.</t>

<t>Many systems make use of geo-location data, and so it's important to
be able describe this data using this geo-location object defined in
this document.</t>

<section title="Portability">
<t>In order to verify portability while developing this module the
following standards and standard APIs and were considered.</t>

<section title="IETF URI Value">
<t><xref target="RFC5870"/> defines a standard URI value for geographic location data. It
includes the ability to specify the <tt>geodetic-value</tt> (it calls this
<tt>crs</tt>) with the default being <tt>wgs-84</tt> <xref target="WGS84"/>. For the location data
it allows 2 to 3 coordinates defined by the <tt>crs</tt> value. For accuracy
it has a single <tt>u</tt> parameter for specifying uncertainty. The <tt>u</tt>
value is in fractions of meters and applies to all the location
values. As the URI is a string, all values are specifies as strings
and so are capable of as much precision as required.</t>

<t>URI values can be mapped to and from the YANG grouping, with the
caveat that some loss of precision (in the extremes) may occur due to
the YANG grouping using decimal64 values rather than strings.</t>

</section>

<section title="W3C">
<t>See <eref target="https://w3c.github.io/geolocation-api/#dom-geolocationposition"/>.</t>

<t>W3C Defines a geo-location API in <xref target="W3CGEO"/>. We show a snippet of
code below which defines the geo-location data for this API. This is
used by many application (e.g., Google Maps API).</t>

<t>W3C API values can be mapped to the YANG grouping, with the caveat
that some loss of precision (in the extremes) may occur due to the

<t>Conversely, only YANG values for The Earth using the default
<tt>wgs-84</tt> <xref target="WGS84"/> as the <tt>geodetic-datum</tt>, can be directly mapped to the
W3C values, as W3C does not provide the extra features necessary to
map the broader set of values supported by the YANG grouping.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="Geography Markup Language (GML)">
<t>ISO adopted the Geography Markup Language (GML) defined by OGC 07-036
as <xref target="ISO.19136.2007"/>. GML defines, among many other things, a position
type <tt>gml:pos</tt> which is a sequence of <tt>double</tt> values. This sequence
of values represent coordinates in a given CRS. The CRS is either
inherited from containing elements or directly specified as
attributes <tt>srsName</tt> and optionally <tt>srsDimension</tt> on the <tt>gml:pos</tt>.</t>

<t>GML defines an Abstract CRS type which Concrete CRS types derive
from. This allows for many types of CRS definitions. We are concerned
with the Geodetic CRS type which can have either ellipsoidal or
Cartesian coordinates. We believe that other non-Earth based CRS as
well as virtual CRS should also be representable by the GML CRS types
as well.</t>

<t>Thus GML <tt>gml:pos</tt> values can be mapped directly to the YANG
grouping, with the caveat that some loss of precision (in the
extremes) may occur due to the YANG grouping using decimal64 values
rather than doubles.</t>

<t>Conversely, YANG grouping values can be mapped to GML as directly as
the GML CRS available definitions allow with a minimum of Earth-based
geodetic systems fully supported.</t>

<t>GML also defines an observation value in <tt>gml:Observation</tt> which
includes a timestamp value <tt>gml:validTime</tt> in addition to other
components such as <tt>gml:using</tt> <tt>gml:target</tt> and <tt>gml:resultOf</tt>. Only
the timestamp is mappable to and from the YANG grouping. Furthermore
<tt>gml:validTime</tt> can either be an Instantaneous measure
(<tt>gml:TimeInstant</tt>) or a time period (<tt>gml:TimePeriod</tt>). Only the
instantaneous <tt>gml:TimeInstant</tt> is mappable to and from the YANG
grouping.</t>

</section>

<section title="KML 2.3">
<t>KML2.2 <xref target="KML22"/> (formerly Keyhole Markup Language) was submitted by
Google to Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
<eref target="https://www.opengeospatial.org/"/> and was adopted. The latest version
as of this writing is <xref target="KML23"/>. This schema includes geographic location
data in some of it's objects (e.g., &lt;kml:Point or &lt;kml:Camera&gt;
objects). This data is provided in string format and corresponds to
the <xref target="W3CGEO"/> values. The timestamp value is also specified as a string
as in our YANG grouping.</t>

<t>KML has some special handling for the height value useful for
visualization software, <tt>kml:altitudeMode</tt>. These values for
<tt>kml:altitudeMode</tt> include indicating the height is ignored
(<tt>clampToGround</tt>), in relation to the locations ground level
(<tt>relativeToGround</tt>), or in relation to the geodetic datum
(<tt>absolute</tt>). The YANG grouping can directly map the ignored and
absolute cases, but not the relative to ground case.</t>

<t>In addition to the <tt>kml:altitudeMode</tt> KML also defines two seafloor
height values using <tt>kml:seaFloorAltitudeMode</tt>. One value is to
ignore the height value (<tt>clampToSeaFloor</tt>) and the other is relative
(<tt>relativeToSeaFloor</tt>). As with the <tt>kml:altitudeMode</tt> value, the
YANG grouping supports the ignore case but not the relative case.</t>

<t>The KML location values use a geodetic datum defined in Annex A by
the GML Coordinate Reference System (CRS) <xref target="ISO.19136.2007"/> with
identifier <tt>LonLat84_5773</tt>. The altitude value for KML absolute
height mode is measured from the vertical datum specified by <xref target="WGS84"/>.</t>

<t>Thus the YANG grouping and KML values can be directly mapped in both
directions (when using a supported altitude mode) with the caveat
that some loss of precision (in the extremes) may occur due to the
YANG grouping using decimal64 values rather than strings. For the
relative height cases the application doing the transformation is
expected to have the data available to transform the relative height
into an absolute height which can then be expressed using the YANG
grouping.</t>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
<section title="Geodetic System Value Registry">
<t>This registry allocates names for standard geodetic systems. Often
these values are referred to using multiple names (e.g., full names
or multiple acronyms values). The intent of this registry is to
provide a single standard value for any given geodetic system.</t>

<t>The values SHOULD use an acronym when available, they MUST be
converted to lower case, and spaces MUST be changed to dashes "-".</t>

<t>It should be noted that <xref target="RFC5870"/> also has a registry for Geodetic
Systems (it calls CRS); however, this registry has a very strict
policy which is believed by the author to be too strict for easily
using.</t>

<t>An open question is whether we should create a new registry or
attempt to modify the existing one. It's worth noting that we include
the ability to specify any geodetic system including ones designed
for astronomical bodies other than the earth, as well as ones based
on alternate systems. These requirements may be too broad for

<t>This document defines a common geo location grouping using the
YANG data modeling language. The grouping itself has no security
or privacy impact on the Internet, but the usage of the grouping
in concrete YANG modules might have. The security considerations

<abstract><t>Many protocols make use of points of extensibility that use constants to identify various protocol parameters.
