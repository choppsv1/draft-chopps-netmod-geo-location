grouping. The geographical location grouping is intended to be used
in YANG models for specifying a location on or in reference to
Earth or any other astronomical object.</t></abstract>  </front>  <middle>

<section title="Introduction">
<t>In many applications we would like to specify the location of
something geographically. Some examples of locations in networking
might be the location of data center, a rack in an internet exchange
point, a router, a firewall, a port on some device, or it could be
the endpoints of a fiber, or perhaps the failure point along a fiber.</t>

<t>Additionally, while this location is typically relative to Earth,
it does not need to be. Indeed, it is easy to imagine a network or
device located on The Moon, on Mars, on Enceladus (the moon of
Saturn) or even a comet (e.g., 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko).</t>

<t>Finally, one can imagine defining locations using different frames
of reference or even alternate systems (e.g., simulations or
virtual realities).</t>

<t>This document defines a <tt>geo-location</tt> YANG grouping that allows for
all the above data to be captured.</t>

<t>This specification conforms to <xref target="ISO.6709.2008"/>.</t>

<t>The YANG data model described in this document conforms to the
Network Management Datastore Architecture defined in <xref target="RFC8342"/>.</t>

<section title="Terminology">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
<xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
as shown here.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="The Geo Location Object">
<section title="Frame of Reference" anchor="sec-frame-of-reference">
<t>The frame of reference (<tt>reference-frame</tt>) defines what the
location values refer to and their meaning. The referred to
object can be any astronomical body. It could be a planet such as
Earth or Mars, a moon such as Enceladus, an asteroid such as
Ceres, or even a comet such as 1P/Halley. This value is specified
in <tt>astronomical-body</tt> and is defined by the <eref target="http://www.iau.org">International
Astronomical Union</eref>. The default <tt>astronomical-body</tt> value is
<tt>earth</tt>.</t>

<t>In addition to identifying the astronomical body, we also need to
define the meaning of the coordinates (e.g., latitude and
longitude) and the definition of 0-height. This is done with a
<tt>geodetic-datum</tt> value. The default value for <tt>geodetic-datum</tt> is
<tt>wgs-84</tt> (i.e., the World Geodetic System, <xref target="WGS84"/>), which is used
by the Global Positioning System (GPS) among many others. We
define an IANA registry for specifying standard values for the
<tt>geodetic-datum</tt>.</t>

<t>In addition to the <tt>geodetic-datum</tt> value, we allow refining the
coordinate and height accuracy using <tt>coord-accuracy</tt> and
<tt>height-accuracy</tt> respectively. When specified, these values
override the defaults implied by the <tt>geodetic-datum</tt> value.</t>

<t>Finally, we define an optional feature which allows for changing
the system for which the above values are defined. This optional
feature adds an <tt>alternate-system</tt> value to the reference frame.
This value is normally not present which implies the natural
universe is the system. The use of this value is intended to
allow for creating virtual realities or perhaps alternate
coordinate systems. The definition of alternate systems is
outside the scope of this document.</t>

</section>

<section title="Location">
<t>This is the location on, or relative to, the astronomical object.
It is specified using 2 or 3 coordinates values. These values are
given either as <tt>latitude</tt>, <tt>longitude</tt>, and an optional
<tt>height</tt>, or as Cartesian coordinates of <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt> and <tt>z</tt>. For
the standard location choice <tt>latitude</tt> and <tt>longitude</tt> are
specified as fractions of decimal degrees, and the <tt>height</tt> value
is in fractions of meters. For the Cartesian choice <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt> and
<tt>z</tt> are in fractions of meters. In both choices the exact
meanings of all the values are defined by the <tt>geodetic-datum</tt>
value in the <xref target="sec-frame-of-reference"></xref>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Motion">
<t>Support is added for objects in relatively stable motion. For
objects in relatively stable motion the grouping provides a
3-dimensional vector value. The components of the vector are
<tt>v-north</tt>, <tt>v-east</tt> and <tt>v-up</tt> which are all given in fractional
meters per second. The values <tt>v-north</tt> and <tt>v-east</tt> are relative
to true north as defined by the reference frame for the
astronomical body, <tt>v-up</tt> is perpendicular to the plane defined
by <tt>v-north</tt> and <tt>v-east</tt>, and is pointed away from the center of
mass.</t>

<t>To derive the 2-dimensional heading and speed one would use the
following formulas:</t>

<artwork><![CDATA[
              ,------------------------------
    speed =  V  v_{north}^{2} + v_{east}^{2}

    heading = arctan(v_{east} / v_{north})
]]></artwork>

<t>For some applications that demand high accuracy, and where the
data is infrequently updated this velocity vector can track very
slow movement such as continental drift.</t>

<t>Tracking more complex forms of motion is outside the scope of
this work. The intent of the grouping being defined here is to
identify where something is located, and generally this is
expected to be somewhere on, or relative to, Earth (or another
astronomical body). At least two options are available to YANG
models that wish to use this grouping with objects that are
changing location frequently in non-simple ways. They can add
additional motion data to their model directly. Or, if the
application allows, it can require more frequent queries to keep
the location data current.</t>

</section>

<section title="Nested Locations">
<t>When locations are nested (e.g., a building may have a location
which houses routers that also have locations) the module using
this grouping is free to indicate in its definition that the
<tt>reference-frame</tt> is inherited from the containing object so that
the <tt>reference-frame</tt> need not be repeated in every instance of
location data.</t>

</section>

<section title="Non-location Attributes">
<t>During the development of this module, the question of whether it
would support data such as orientation arose. These types of
attributes are outside the scope of this grouping because they do
not deal with a location but rather describe something more about
the object that is at the location. Module authors are free to
add these non-location attributes along with their use of this
location grouping.</t>

</section>

<section title="Tree">
<t>The following is the YANG tree diagram <xref target="RFC8340"/> for the
geo-location grouping.</t>

<section title="ISO 6709:2008 Conformance">
<t><xref target="ISO.6709.2008"/> provides an appendix with a set of tests for
conformance to the standard. The tests and results are given in the
following table along with an explanation of non-applicable tests.</t>

<table>
<name>Conformance Test Results</name>
<thead><tr><th>Test</th><th>Description</th><th>Pass Explanation</th></tr>

<t>For test <tt>A.1.2.1</tt> the YANG geo location object either includes a CRS
(<tt>reference-frame</tt>) or has a default defined (<xref target="WGS84"/>).</t>

<t>For <tt>A.1.2.3</tt> we do not define our own CRS, and doing so is not
required for conformance.</t>

<t>For <tt>A.1.2.6</tt> we do not define a text string representation, which is
also not required for conformance.</t>

</section>

<section title="Usability">
<t>The geo-location object defined in this document and YANG module have
been designed to be usable in a very broad set of applications.
This includes the ability to locate things on astronomical bodies
other than Earth, and to utilize entirely different coordinate
systems and realities.</t>

<section title="Portability">
<t>In order to verify portability while developing this module the
following standards and standard APIs and were considered.</t>

<section title="IETF URI Value">
<t><xref target="RFC5870"/> defines a standard URI value for geographic location data. It
includes the ability to specify the <tt>geodetic-value</tt> (it calls this
<tt>crs</tt>) with the default being <tt>wgs-84</tt> <xref target="WGS84"/>. For the location data
it allows 2 to 3 coordinates defined by the <tt>crs</tt> value. For accuracy,
it has a single <tt>u</tt> parameter for specifying uncertainty. The <tt>u</tt>
value is in fractions of meters and applies to all the location
values. As the URI is a string, all values are specifies as strings
and so are capable of as much precision as required.</t>

<t>URI values can be mapped to and from the YANG grouping, with the
caveat that some loss of precision (in the extremes) may occur due to
the YANG grouping using decimal64 values rather than strings.</t>

</section>

<section title="W3C">
<t>W3C Defines a geo-location API in <xref target="W3CGEO"/>. We show a snippet of
code below which defines the geo-location data for this API. This is
used by many applications (e.g., Google Maps API).</t>

<section title="Geography Markup Language (GML)">
<t>ISO adopted the Geography Markup Language (GML) defined by OGC 07-036
as <xref target="ISO.19136.2007"/>. GML defines, among many other things, a position
type <tt>gml:pos</tt> which is a sequence of <tt>double</tt> values. This sequence
of values represent coordinates in a given CRS. The CRS is either
inherited from containing elements or directly specified as
attributes <tt>srsName</tt> and optionally <tt>srsDimension</tt> on the <tt>gml:pos</tt>.</t>

<t>GML defines an Abstract CRS type which Concrete CRS types derive
from. This allows for many types of CRS definitions. We are concerned
with the Geodetic CRS type which can have either ellipsoidal or
Cartesian coordinates. We believe that other non-Earth based CRS as
well as virtual CRS should also be representable by the GML CRS types
as well.</t>

<t>Thus, GML <tt>gml:pos</tt> values can be mapped directly to the YANG
grouping, with the caveat that some loss of precision (in the
extremes) may occur due to the YANG grouping using decimal64 values
rather than doubles.</t>

<t>Conversely, YANG grouping values can be mapped to GML as directly as
the GML CRS available definitions allow with a minimum of Earth-based
geodetic systems fully supported.</t>

<t>GML also defines an observation value in <tt>gml:Observation</tt> which
includes a timestamp value <tt>gml:validTime</tt> in addition to other
components such as <tt>gml:using</tt> <tt>gml:target</tt> and <tt>gml:resultOf</tt>. Only
the timestamp is mappable to and from the YANG grouping. Furthermore,
<tt>gml:validTime</tt> can either be an Instantaneous measure
(<tt>gml:TimeInstant</tt>) or a time period (<tt>gml:TimePeriod</tt>). The
instantaneous <tt>gml:TimeInstant</tt> is mappable to and from the YANG
grouping <tt>timestamp</tt> value, and values down to the resolution of
seconds for <tt>gml:TimePeriod</tt> can be mapped using the <tt>valid-until</tt>
node of the YANG grouping.</t>

</section>

<section title="KML">
<t>KML 2.2 <xref target="KML22"/> (formerly Keyhole Markup Language) was submitted by
Google to the <eref target="https://www.opengeospatial.org/">Open Geospatial Consortium,</eref> and was adopted. The latest
version as of this writing is KML 2.3 <xref target="KML23"/>. This schema includes
geographic location data in some of its objects (e.g., <tt>kml:Point</tt> or
<tt>kml:Camera</tt> objects). This data is provided in string format and
corresponds to the <xref target="W3CGEO"/> values. The timestamp value is also
specified as a string as in our YANG grouping.</t>

<t>KML has some special handling for the height value useful for
visualization software, <tt>kml:altitudeMode</tt>. These values for
<tt>kml:altitudeMode</tt> include indicating the height is ignored
(<tt>clampToGround</tt>), in relation to the location's ground level
(<tt>relativeToGround</tt>), or in relation to the geodetic datum
(<tt>absolute</tt>). The YANG grouping can directly map the ignored and
absolute cases, but not the relative to ground case.</t>

<t>In addition to the <tt>kml:altitudeMode</tt> KML also defines two seafloor
height values using <tt>kml:seaFloorAltitudeMode</tt>. One value is to
ignore the height value (<tt>clampToSeaFloor</tt>) and the other is relative
(<tt>relativeToSeaFloor</tt>). As with the <tt>kml:altitudeMode</tt> value, the
YANG grouping supports the ignore case but not the relative case.</t>

<t>The KML location values use a geodetic datum defined in Annex A by
the GML Coordinate Reference System (CRS) <xref target="ISO.19136.2007"/> with
identifier <tt>LonLat84_5773</tt>. The altitude value for KML absolute
height mode is measured from the vertical datum specified by <xref target="WGS84"/>.</t>

<t>Thus, the YANG grouping and KML values can be directly mapped in both
directions (when using a supported altitude mode) with the caveat
that some loss of precision (in the extremes) may occur due to the
YANG grouping using decimal64 values rather than strings. For the
relative height cases, the application doing the transformation is
expected to have the data available to transform the relative height
into an absolute height, which can then be expressed using the YANG
grouping.</t>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
<section title="Geodetic System Values Registry">
<t>IANA is asked to create a new registry "Geodetic System Values" under
a new protocol category group "YANG Geographic Location Parameters".</t>

<t>This registry allocates names for standard geodetic systems. Often
these values are referred to using multiple names (e.g., full names
or multiple acronyms values). The intent of this registry is to
provide a single standard value for any given geodetic system.</t>

<t>The values SHOULD use an acronym when available, they MUST be
converted to lower case, and spaces MUST be changed to dashes "-".</t>

<t>Each entry should be sufficient to define the 3 coordinate values (2
if height is not required). So for example the <tt>wgs-84</tt> is defined as
WGS-84 with the geoid updated by at least <xref target="EGM96"/> for height values.
Specific entries for <xref target="EGM96"/> and <xref target="EGM08"/> are present if a more precise
definition of the data is required.</t>

<t>It should be noted that <xref target="RFC5870"/> also creates a registry for Geodetic
Systems (it calls CRS); however, this registry has a very strict
modification policy. The authors of <xref target="RFC5870"/> have the stated goal of
making CRS registration hard to avoid proliferation of CRS values. As
our module defines alternate systems and has a broader (beyond Earth)
scope, the registry defined below is meant to be more easily modified.</t>

<t>The allocation policy for this registry is First Come, First Served,
<xref target="RFC8126"/> as the intent is simply to avoid duplicate values.</t>

<t>The initial values for this registry are as follows.</t>

<table>

<thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr><td>me</td><td>Mean Earth/Polar Axis (Moon)</td></tr>
<tr><td>mola-vik-1</td><td>MOLA Height, IAU Viking-1 PM (Mars)</td></tr>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.  The lowest NETCONF layer
is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
transport is Secure Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242"/>.  The lowest RESTCONF layer
is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
<xref target="RFC8446"/>.</t>

<t>The NETCONF access control model <xref target="RFC8341"/> provides the means to
restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
operations and content.</t>

<t>Since the modules defined in this document only define groupings,
these considerations are primarily for the designers of other modules
that use these groupings.</t>

<t>All the data nodes defined in this YANG module are
writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., "config true", which is the
default). These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
in some network environments. Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to
these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect
on network operations. These are the subtrees and data nodes and
their sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

<t>None of the writable/creatable/deletable data nodes in the YANG
module defined in this document are by themselves considered more
sensitive or vulnerable than standard configuration.</t>

<t>Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:</t>

<t>Since the grouping defined in this module identifies locations,
authors using this grouping SHOULD consider any privacy issues
that may arise when the data is readable (e.g., customer device
locations, etc).</t>

<t>This document does not define any RPC actions and hence this section
does not consider the security of RPCs.</t>

<abstract><t>The standardization of network configuration interfaces for use with the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) or the RESTCONF protocol requires a structured and secure operating environment that promotes human usability and multi-vendor interoperability.  There is a need for standard mechanisms to restrict NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol access for particular users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content.  This document defines such an access control model.</t><t>This document obsoletes RFC 6536.</t></abstract>
