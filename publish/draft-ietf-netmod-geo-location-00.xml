grouping. The geographical location grouping is intended to be used
in YANG models for specifying a location on or in reference to the
Earth or any other astronomical object.</t></abstract>  </front>  <middle>

<section title="Introduction">
<t>In many applications we would like to specify the location of
something geographically. Some examples of locations in networking
might be the location of data center, a rack in an internet exchange
point, a router, a firewall, a port on some device, or it could be
the endpoints of a fiber, or perhaps the failure point along a fiber.</t>

<t>Additionally, while this location is typically relative to The Earth,
it does not need to be. Indeed it is easy to imagine a network or
device located on The Moon, on Mars, on Enceladus (the moon of
Saturn) or even a comet (e.g., 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko).</t>

<t>Finally, one can imagine defining locations using different frames
of reference or even alternate systems (e.g., simulations or
virtual realities).</t>

<t>This document defines a <spanx style='verb'>geo-location</spanx> YANG grouping that allows for
all of the above data to be captured.</t>

<t>This specification conforms to <xref target="ISO.6709.2008"/>.</t>

<t>The YANG data model described in this document conforms to the
Network Management Datastore Architecture defined in <xref target="RFC8342"/>.</t>

<section title="Terminology">
<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
<xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
as shown here.</t>

</section>

</section>

<section title="The Geo Location Object">
<section title="Frame of Reference" anchor="sec-frame-of-reference">
<t>The frame of reference (<spanx style='verb'>reference-frame</spanx>) defines what the
location values refer to and their meaning. The referred to
object can be any astronomical body. It could be a planet such as
The Earth or Mars, a moon such as Enceladus, an asteroid such as
Ceres, or even a comet such as 1P/Halley. This value is specified
in <spanx style='verb'>astronomical-body</spanx> and is defined by the International
Astronomical Union (<eref target="http://www.iau.org"/>), The default
<spanx style='verb'>astronomical-body</spanx> value is <spanx style='verb'>earth</spanx>.</t>

<t>In addition to identifying the astronomical body we also need to
define the meaning of the coordinates (e.g., latitude and
longitude) and the definition of 0-height. This is done with a
<spanx style='verb'>geodetic-datum</spanx> value. The default value for <spanx style='verb'>geodetic-datum</spanx> is
<spanx style='verb'>wgs-84</spanx> (i.e., the World Geodetic System, <xref target="WGS84"/>), which is used
by the Global Positioning System (GPS) among many others. We
define an IANA registry for specifying standard values for the
<spanx style='verb'>geodetic-datum</spanx>.</t>

<t>In addition to the <spanx style='verb'>geodetic-datum</spanx> value we allow refining the
coordinate and height accuracy using <spanx style='verb'>coord-accuracy</spanx> and
<spanx style='verb'>height-accuracy</spanx> respectively. When specified these values
override the defaults implied by the <spanx style='verb'>geodetic-datum</spanx> value.</t>

<t>Finally, we define an optional feature which allows for changing
the system for which the above values are defined. This optional
feature adds an <spanx style='verb'>alternate-system</spanx> value to the reference frame.
This value is normally not present which implies the natural
universe is the system. The use of this value is intended to
allow for creating virtual realities or perhaps alternate
coordinate systems. The definition of alternate systems is
outside the scope of this document.</t>

</section>

<section title="Location">
<t>This is the location on or relative to the astronomical object.
It is specified using 2 or 3 coordinates values. These values are
given either as <spanx style='verb'>latitude</spanx>, <spanx style='verb'>longitude</spanx>, and an optional
<spanx style='verb'>height</spanx>, or as Cartesian coordinates of <spanx style='verb'>x</spanx>, <spanx style='verb'>y</spanx> and an optional
<spanx style='verb'>z</spanx>. For the standard location choice <spanx style='verb'>latitude</spanx> and <spanx style='verb'>longitude</spanx>
are specified as fractions of decimal degrees, and the <spanx style='verb'>height</spanx>
value is in fractions of meters. For the Cartesian choice <spanx style='verb'>x</spanx>,
<spanx style='verb'>y</spanx> and <spanx style='verb'>z</spanx> are in fractions of meters. In both choices the exact
meanings of all of the values are defined by the <spanx style='verb'>geodetic-datum</spanx>
value in the <xref target="sec-frame-of-reference"></xref>.</t>

</section>

<section title="Motion">
<t>Support is added for objects in relatively stable motion. For
objects in relatively stable motion the grouping provides a
3-dimensional vector value. The components of the vector are
<spanx style='verb'>v-north</spanx>, <spanx style='verb'>v-east</spanx> and <spanx style='verb'>v-up</spanx> which are all given in fractional
meters per second. The values <spanx style='verb'>v-north</spanx> and <spanx style='verb'>v-east</spanx> are relative
to true-north as defined by the reference frame for the
astronomical body, <spanx style='verb'>v-up</spanx> is perpendicular to the plane defined
by <spanx style='verb'>v-north</spanx> and <spanx style='verb'>v-east</spanx>, and is pointed away from the center of
mass.</t>

<t>To derive the 2-dimensional heading and speed one would use the
following formulas:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
              ,------------------------------
    speed =  V  v_{north}^{2} + v_{east}^{2}

    heading = arctan(v_{east} / v_{north})
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>For some applications that demand high accuracy, and where the
data is infrequently updated this velocity vector can track very
slow movement such as continental drift.</t>

<t>Tracking more complex forms of motion is outside the scope of
this work. The intent of the grouping being defined here is to
identify where something is located, and generally this is
expected to be somewhere on or relative to the Earth (or another
astronomical body). At least two options are available to YANG
models that wish to use this grouping with objects that are
changing location frequently in non-simple ways, they can add
additional motion data to their model directly, or if the
application allows it can require more frequent queries to keep
the location data current.</t>

</section>

<section title="Nested Locations">
<t>When locations are nested (e.g., a building may have a location
which houses routers that also have locations) the module using
this grouping is free to indicate in its definition that the
<spanx style='verb'>reference-frame</spanx> is inherited from the containing object so that
the <spanx style='verb'>reference-frame</spanx> need not be repeated in every instance of
location data.</t>

</section>

<section title="Non-location Attributes">
<t>During the development of this module, the question of whether it
would support data such as orientation arose. These types of
attributes are outside the scope of this grouping because they do
not deal with a location but rather describe something more about
the object that is at the location. Module authors are free to
add these non-location attributes along with their use of this
location grouping.</t>

</section>

<section title="Tree">
<t>The following is the YANG tree diagram <xref target="RFC8340"/> for the
geo-location grouping.</t>

<t>For test <spanx style='verb'>A.1.2.1</spanx> the YANG geo location object either includes a CRS
(<spanx style='verb'>reference-frame</spanx>) or has a default defined (<xref target="WGS84"/>).</t>

<t>For <spanx style='verb'>A.1.2.3</spanx> we do not define our own CRS, and doing so is not
required for conformance.</t>

<t>For <spanx style='verb'>A.1.2.6</spanx> we do not define a text string representation, which is
also not required for conformance.</t>

</section>

<section title="Usability">
<t>The geo-location object defined in this document and YANG module have
been designed to be usable in a very broad set of applications.
This includes the ability to locate things on astronomical bodies
other than The Earth, and to utilize entirely different coordinate
systems and realities.</t>

<t>Many systems make use of geo-location data, and so it's important to
be able describe this data using this geo-location object defined in
this document.</t>

<section title="Portability">
<t>In order to verify portability while developing this module the
following standards and standard APIs and were considered.</t>

<section title="IETF URI Value">
<t><xref target="RFC5870"/> defines a standard URI value for geographic location data. It
includes the ability to specify the <spanx style='verb'>geodetic-value</spanx> (it calls this
<spanx style='verb'>crs</spanx>) with the default being <spanx style='verb'>wgs-84</spanx> <xref target="WGS84"/>. For the location data
it allows 2 to 3 coordinates defined by the <spanx style='verb'>crs</spanx> value. For accuracy
it has a single <spanx style='verb'>u</spanx> parameter for specifying uncertainty. The <spanx style='verb'>u</spanx>
value is in fractions of meters and applies to all the location
values. As the URI is a string, all values are specifies as strings
and so are capable of as much precision as required.</t>

<t>URI values can be mapped to and from the YANG grouping, with the
caveat that some loss of precision (in the extremes) may occur due to
the YANG grouping using decimal64 values rather than strings.</t>

</section>

<section title="W3C">
<t>See <eref target="https://w3c.github.io/geolocation-api/#dom-geolocationposition"/>.</t>

<t>W3C Defines a geo-location API in <xref target="W3CGEO"/>. We show a snippet of
code below which defines the geo-location data for this API. This is
used by many application (e.g., Google Maps API).</t>

<t>W3C API values can be mapped to the YANG grouping, with the caveat
that some loss of precision (in the extremes) may occur due to the

<t>Conversely, only YANG values for The Earth using the default
<spanx style='verb'>wgs-84</spanx> <xref target="WGS84"/> as the <spanx style='verb'>geodetic-datum</spanx>, can be directly mapped to the
W3C values, as W3C does not provide the extra features necessary to
map the broader set of values supported by the YANG grouping.</t>

<section title="Geography Markup Language (GML)">
<t>ISO adopted the Geography Markup Language (GML) defined by OGC 07-036
as <xref target="ISO.19136.2007"/>. GML defines, among many other things, a position
type <spanx style='verb'>gml:pos</spanx> which is a sequence of <spanx style='verb'>double</spanx> values. This sequence
of values represent coordinates in a given CRS. The CRS is either
inherited from containing elements or directly specified as
attributes <spanx style='verb'>srsName</spanx> and optionally <spanx style='verb'>srsDimension</spanx> on the <spanx style='verb'>gml:pos</spanx>.</t>

<t>GML defines an Abstract CRS type which Concrete CRS types derive
from. This allows for many types of CRS definitions. We are concerned
with the Geodetic CRS type which can have either ellipsoidal or
Cartesian coordinates. We believe that other non-Earth based CRS as
well as virtual CRS should also be representable by the GML CRS types
as well.</t>

<t>Thus GML <spanx style='verb'>gml:pos</spanx> values can be mapped directly to the YANG
grouping, with the caveat that some loss of precision (in the
extremes) may occur due to the YANG grouping using decimal64 values
rather than doubles.</t>

<t>Conversely, YANG grouping values can be mapped to GML as directly as
the GML CRS available definitions allow with a minimum of Earth-based
geodetic systems fully supported.</t>

<t>GML also defines an observation value in <spanx style='verb'>gml:Observation</spanx> which
includes a timestamp value <spanx style='verb'>gml:validTime</spanx> in addition to other
components such as <spanx style='verb'>gml:using</spanx> <spanx style='verb'>gml:target</spanx> and <spanx style='verb'>gml:resultOf</spanx>. Only
the timestamp is mappable to and from the YANG grouping. Furthermore
<spanx style='verb'>gml:validTime</spanx> can either be an Instantaneous measure
(<spanx style='verb'>gml:TimeInstant</spanx>) or a time period (<spanx style='verb'>gml:TimePeriod</spanx>). Only the
instantaneous <spanx style='verb'>gml:TimeInstant</spanx> is mappable to and from the YANG
grouping.</t>

<section title="KML">
<t>KML 2.2 <xref target="KML22"/> (formerly Keyhole Markup Language) was submitted by
Google to Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
<eref target="https://www.opengeospatial.org/"/> and was adopted. The latest version
as of this writing is KML 2.3 <xref target="KML23"/>. This schema includes geographic
location data in some of it's objects (e.g., &lt;kml:Point or
&lt;kml:Camera&gt; objects). This data is provided in string format and
corresponds to the <xref target="W3CGEO"/> values. The timestamp value is also
specified as a string as in our YANG grouping.</t>

<t>KML has some special handling for the height value useful for
visualization software, <spanx style='verb'>kml:altitudeMode</spanx>. These values for
<spanx style='verb'>kml:altitudeMode</spanx> include indicating the height is ignored
(<spanx style='verb'>clampToGround</spanx>), in relation to the locations ground level
(<spanx style='verb'>relativeToGround</spanx>), or in relation to the geodetic datum
(<spanx style='verb'>absolute</spanx>). The YANG grouping can directly map the ignored and
absolute cases, but not the relative to ground case.</t>

<t>In addition to the <spanx style='verb'>kml:altitudeMode</spanx> KML also defines two seafloor
height values using <spanx style='verb'>kml:seaFloorAltitudeMode</spanx>. One value is to
ignore the height value (<spanx style='verb'>clampToSeaFloor</spanx>) and the other is relative
(<spanx style='verb'>relativeToSeaFloor</spanx>). As with the <spanx style='verb'>kml:altitudeMode</spanx> value, the
YANG grouping supports the ignore case but not the relative case.</t>

<t>The KML location values use a geodetic datum defined in Annex A by
the GML Coordinate Reference System (CRS) <xref target="ISO.19136.2007"/> with
identifier <spanx style='verb'>LonLat84_5773</spanx>. The altitude value for KML absolute
height mode is measured from the vertical datum specified by <xref target="WGS84"/>.</t>

<t>Thus the YANG grouping and KML values can be directly mapped in both
directions (when using a supported altitude mode) with the caveat
that some loss of precision (in the extremes) may occur due to the
YANG grouping using decimal64 values rather than strings. For the
relative height cases the application doing the transformation is
expected to have the data available to transform the relative height
into an absolute height which can then be expressed using the YANG
grouping.</t>

<section title="IANA Considerations">
<section title="Geodetic System Value Registry">
<t>This registry allocates names for standard geodetic systems. Often
these values are referred to using multiple names (e.g., full names
or multiple acronyms values). The intent of this registry is to
provide a single standard value for any given geodetic system.</t>

<t>The values SHOULD use an acronym when available, they MUST be
converted to lower case, and spaces MUST be changed to dashes "-".</t>

<t>Each entry should be sufficient to define the 3 coordinate values (2
if height is not required). So for example the <spanx style='verb'>wgs-84</spanx> is defined as
WGS-84 with the geoid updated by at least <xref target="EGM96"/> for height values.
Specific entries for <xref target="EGM96"/> and <xref target="EGM08"/> are present if a more precise
definition of the data is required.</t>

<t>It should be noted that <xref target="RFC5870"/> also creates a registry for Geodetic
Systems (it calls CRS); however, this registry has a very strict
modification policy. The authors of <xref target="RFC5870"/> have the stated goal of
making CRS registration hard to avoid proliferation of CRS values. As
our module defines alternate systems and has a broader (beyond earth)
scope, the registry defined below is meant to be more easily modified.</t>

<t>TODO: Open question, should we create a new registry here or attempt
to modify the one created by <xref target="RFC5870"/>. It's worth noting that we
include the ability to specify any geodetic system including ones
designed for astronomical bodies other than the earth, as well as
ones based on alternate systems. These requirements may be too broad
for adapting the existing <xref target="RFC5870"/> registry.</t>

<t>TODO: Open question, is FCFS too easy, perhaps expert review would
strike a good balance. If expert review is acceptable, would it also
be acceptable to update the policy on <xref target="RFC5870"/> and use it instead?</t>

<t>The allocation policy for this registry is First Come First Served,
<xref target="RFC8126"/> as the intent is simply to avoid duplicate values.</t>

<t>The initial values for this registry are as follows.</t>

<texttable>
<ttcol>Name</ttcol><ttcol>Description</ttcol>
<c>me</c><c>Mean Earth/Polar Axis (Moon)</c>
<c>mola-vik-1</c><c>MOLA Height, IAU Viking-1 PM (Mars)</c>
<c>wgs-84-96</c><c>World Geodetic System 1984 <xref target="WGS84"/> w/ EGM96</c>
<c>wgs-84-08</c><c>World Geodetic System 1984 <xref target="WGS84"/> w/ <xref target="EGM08"/></c>
